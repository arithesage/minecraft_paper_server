# Minecraft Paper Server

This package allows to quickly setup a Minecraf server using Paper.

It also includes some Spigot plugins (they are compatible with Paper) i found
useful along with some basic configuration. Each plugin includes an
HTML file that will direct you to the plugin website.

Two of them, Geyser and Floodgate, are included to provide compatibility with
Minecraft Bedrock edition.

Also, a \_disabled and a \_extra folders are included.

The \_disabled one is intended for putting those plugins to be disabled
(quite obvious). The \_extra one contains some plugins that, while may
not be essentials, i have found them interesting.

Scripts for both Linux and Windows are provided.
